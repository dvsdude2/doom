_______________________________
#### More than just dotconfigs

    keep configs to save the work I put into making them.
    plan on keeping a lot of my arch set up here. so not all config files
    the plan is to use these settings for any new builds in future.

**STEP_ONE**
if already installed.
  * [ ] backup your .emacs.d folder. to do this,
simply put .bak at the end of the file name.

after install.

all extra packages have been added to package.el
