;; The GC introduces annoying pauses and stuttering into our Emacs experience,
;; so we use `gcmh' to stave off the GC while we're using Emacs, and provoke it
;; when it's idle. However, if the idle delay is too long, we run the risk of
;; runaway memory usage in busy sessions. And if it's too low, then we may as
;; well not be using gcmh at all.
