;;; Commentary:

;; Now you can count down important events with friends & family from within
;; Emacs!  Subscriptions?  Yuck!  Stop paying $10 a month for "turn-key"
;; solutions to animate your countdowns.  They don't even have integration hooks
;; or customizations!

;;; Usage:

;; For a quick manual countdown, M-x champagne will just ask you for a number of
;; seconds.

;; For a basic countdown, starting right now:
;; (champagne 5)
;;
;; Count down to some point in the future:
;; (champagne nil "Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 2025")
;; (champagne nil "12:00am") ; will use tomorrow if necessary
;; (champagne nil "12:00") ; ⚠️ read as military time, tomorrow if necessary
;; (champagne nil 60) ; one minute from now
;; (champagne nil "2 hours 10 minutes") ; two hours and 10 minutes from now
;; (champagne nil (25945 48350 688785 440000)) ; you like Emacs time lists
;;
;; Count down and call a function at the beginning of the countdown
;; (champagne nil nil #'parrot-start-animation)
;;
;; Count down and call a function at the end of the countdown
;; (champagne nil nil nil #'snow)
;;
;; Count down with all behaviors
;; (champagne 60 "Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 2025" #'parrot-start-animation #'snow)

DURATION is the number of seconds that will be counted down,

DURATION is used instead.

GOAL-TIME supports a number of formats:

- nil: start immediately
- number: seconds from now
- string: valid arguments to `timer-duration' or `timer-relative-time' or as a
  fallback, `parse-time-string'.  Examples of valid values:
  hh:mm
  hh:mm:ss
  2 hours 35 minutes
  2 hour 35 min
  11:23pm
  Wed Jan 1 00:00:00 2025
See `timer-duration-words' for details of using `timer-duration' style.  See
`diary-entry-time' for more valid 11:23PM style times.
